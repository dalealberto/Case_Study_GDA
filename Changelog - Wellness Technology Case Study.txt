Changelog - Wellness Technology Case Study

***Note: There will be six phases of the data analysis process: ASK, PREPARE, PROCESS, ANALYZE, SHARE, ACT

Version 0.01 (02-24-2024)
- Created Case Study word document
- Wrote the introduction for the case study
- Started the ASK phase
- Defined business task 
- Defined key stakeholders


Version 0.02 (02-25-2024)
- Finished the ASK phase
- Started and finished the PREPARE phase 
- Determined source of data
- Determined which files to use and why 
- Determined key concerns (privacy, credibility, bias, etc.)
- Provided code I used to check credibility of dataset
- Started the PROCESS phase 
- Checked for blanks or null values in dataset
- Cross referenced main data 'dailyActivity_merged' with 'dailyIntensities_merged' to check for same values/data
- Encountered issue with R reading floating-point numbers resulting in FALSE logical test when comparing the values of the two files
- Tried to use functions round() and near() to resolve this issue but nothing was resolved. Will try again tomorrow


Version 0.03 (02-26-2024)
- Continued the PROCESS phase 
- Issue with floating-point numbers from Version 0.02 was resolved somehow. Perhaps restarting R fixed a bug because it was reading
floating-point numbers correctly now using the logical tests
- Modified PREPARE phase: added point that questioned the ambiguity of the fields from 'dailyActivity_merged' file and their values
- Removed 3 duplicates in 'sleepDay_merged' file and 410 unique values remained
- Removed 543 duplicates in 'minuteSleep_merged' file and 187978 unique values remained
- Converted the ActivityDate column from 'dailyActivity_merged' file and converted the values from 'general' format to 'date' format. Saved the whole file into a new file 'dailyActivity_merged_cleaned' 


Version 0.04 (02-27-2024)
- Continued then finished the PROCESS phase
- split the values in the date columns into three columns 'Date', 'Time', 'AM_or_PM' then converted data type accordingly for all the applicable files such as 'hourlyIntensities_merged', 'weightLogInfo_merged', etc. 
- determined 'Fat' column in 'weightLogInfo_merged' file had way too many blanks and only 2 values. will not analyze this column
- standardized all column names by capitalizing the first letter of all columns to keep it consistent with the other files
- verified that the data type of the date and time columns of files correctly show as "Date" and "Time" using R's glimpse() function
- cleaned the 'heartrate_seconds_merged' file using SQL and R as the file was too large to work with in Excel
- Finished the PROCESS phase


Version 0.05 (02-28-2024)
- Started the ANALYZE phase
- Created graphs for the following files:
	* dailyActivity_merged_cleaned
	* heartrate_seconds_merged_cleaned 
	* hourlyCalories_merged_cleaned
	* hourlyIntensities_merged_cleaned

Version 0.06 (02-29-2024)
- Finished the ANALYZE phase
- Created graphs for the following files:
	* hourlySteps_merged_cleaned
	* minuteSleep_merged_cleaned
	* sleepDay_merged_cleaned
	* weightLogInfo_merged_cleaned

Version 0.07 (03-1-2024)
- Created the R Markdown file 
- Completed the following sections in R Markdown:
	* Introduction
	* Phase 1: Ask
	* Phase 2: Prepare
	* Phase 3: Process
	* Phase 4: Analyze & Share

Version 0.08 (03-2-2024)
- Finished the R Markdown file
- Completed the following sections in R Markdown:
	* Phase 5: Conclusion

Version 0.09 (03-3-2024)
