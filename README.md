# Case_Study_GDA

Note: I worked on this [case study](https://dalealberto.github.io/Case_Study_GDA/) for the completion of my Google Data Analytics course. I have included all the files I used to work on my case study in separate folders. The 'docs' folder is just a way for GitHub to host my site. However, you can download the index.rmd file to see my full code. 

In this case study, I used FitBit tracking data to assess the health behaviors and identify patterns in the daily and monthly physical activities and sleep routines of FitBit users. Drawing from these insights, I created an actionable strategy formulated for Bellabeat's Time watch, aimed at fostering the company's business expansion.

To view the glossary of the course and the source code to automate this task, check out my [Python repository](https://github.com/dalealberto/Case_Study_GDA/tree/main/Python)
