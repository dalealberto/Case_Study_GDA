# Case_Study_GDA

Note:I worked on this [case study](https://dalealberto.github.io/Case_Study_GDA/) for the completion of my Google Data Analytics course. I have included all the files I used to work on my case study in separate folders. The 'docs' folder is just a way for GitHub to host my site. However, you can download the index.rmd file to see my full code. 

In this case study, I used FitBit tracking data to evaluate the health habits and determine trends among FitBit users' daily and monthly physical activities and sleep patterns. Based on those findings, I was ultimately able to develop an action plan for Bellabeat's Time watch to further drive the company's business growth. 

Thank you for reading!
