# Case_Study_GDA

I worked on this [case study](https://dalealberto.github.io/Case_Study_GDA/) for the completion of my Google Data Analytics course. I have included all the files I used to work on my case study in separate folders. The 'docs' folder is just a way for GitHub to host my site. However, you can download the index.rmd file to see my full code. 

Thank you for reading!
