# Case_Study_GDA

Note: I worked on this [case study](https://dalealberto.github.io/Case_Study_GDA/) for the completion of my Google Data Analytics course. I have included all the files I used to work on my case study in separate folders. The 'docs' folder is just a way for GitHub to host my site. However, you can download the index.rmd file to see my full code. 

In this case study, I used FitBit tracking data to assess the health behaviors and identify patterns in the daily and monthly physical activities and sleep routines of FitBit users. Drawing from these insights, I created an actionable strategy formulated for Bellabeat's Time watch, aimed at fostering the company's business expansion.

Thank you for reading!
